## Project Objectives:

1. Identify the “hot” categories to incentivise better quality meetups on this subject
2. Identify the most popular groups to partner with / promote
3. Improve meetup experience for users and companies - by providing suggestions based on customer preferences and by connecting them to popular groups and their target market

## Dataset:
9 csv files comprising of:
* 10.5 Million member data across 3 major cities - New York, San Francisco, Chicago
* 2600 topics, 2500 topics
* 78,000 venues, 5800 events

## Analysis:

* Inference: Career/Business, Tech, and Socialization are the three most popular and fast growing categories based on the 3 cities data.

* Suggestion: Incentivize growth of better quality groups in these categories by targeting user bases like interested University students or people working in the relevant industry.

**2. Popular groups in New York and in San Francisco (by # of memebers)**

* Suggestion: Now that we have identified the popular groups in New York and San Francisco from the above analysis, we need to attract top relevant company sponsorship into popular groups in exchange for better talent hunting opportunities and crowd connect. This can be monetized by meetup.com as a percentage of the sponsorship from the group.
